            <p><b>Robbery</b> is the taking or attempting to take anything of value under confrontational circumstances from the victim by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear of immediate harm. Also includes when a robber threatens, displays, or uses a weapon or transports the victim to obtain his/her money or possessions. <br><br>

<b>Main mitigation measure</b> as in the case with the physical assault is to use situational awareness and exercise extra vigilance in the following situations:<br>

* when approaching drunk people;<br>
* when approaching people who exhibit inappropriate behavior;<br>
* when walking near places with bad reputations (certain bars, night clubs etc.);<br>
* when walking alone in a remote and isolated places after dark.<br><br>

<b>The response to the robbery</b> may be one or a combination of the following: <br>
<u>* Active resistance.</u> Attempting to fight off or distract the attacker using anger or physical force, including struggling, screaming, or escaping. This could lead to an increasingly violent response. <br>
<u>* Passive resistance. </u> Doing or saying anything that will intimidate an attacker or persuade them to change their mind. <br>
<u>* No resistance. </u> Doing nothing at all. In many cases this conscious choice would minimize harm done during the incident, especially if the offender has a weapon. <br><br>


<b>In case robbery happened:</b><br>
1. Call your point of contact in the country immediately. Be prepared to report exactly what was stolen: cash, bank cards, property (cell phone, digital camera, etc.) and the circumstances of the robbery: place, method used and if there are any suspects.<br>
2. Call a doctor if you need medical assistance or counselling after the incident. <br>
3. If bank cards were taken, call 24-hour bank card service center in Ukraine and/or your country bank depending on the cards origin and block them ASAP.<br>
4. If passport and/or temporary residence permit (“posvidka”) are stolen, police report must be filed.<br>
5. If a property that is covered with insurance was stolen police report is required for claiming insurance reimbursement.<br>
