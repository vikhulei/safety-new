            <p><b>Stalking</b> is a situation when the same offender is demonstrating a threatening behavior composed of more than one act across a short period of time, that would cause a reasonable person to either fear for his or her safety or the safety of others and/or suffer substantial emotional distress. <br><br>

This behavior includes repeatedly maintaining unwanted visual or physical proximity to a person; conveying oral or written threats, implicitly threatening conduct, or any combination of these directed at or toward a person; or directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, following, monitoring, observing, surveilling, threatening, or communicating to or about a person. <br><br>



There are scenarios in Ukrainian culture that have similar characteristics to stalking in U.S. society but do not represent that same danger in the local cultural context. These instances can often be mitigated most effectively by culturally appropriate interventions. <br><br>


Your local contacts may be able to help you devise culturally appropriate responses to these scenarios, as well as help you recognize when certain actions do present a threat in your current context. <br>
