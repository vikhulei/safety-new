            <p><b>Sexual assault</b> is a situation when another person, without the consent, intentionally or knowingly <br>
* touches or contacts, either directly or through clothing, sexual parts of the victim; OR<br> 
* kisses the victim on the mouth, ear, or neck; OR <br>
* disrobes the victim; OR <br>
* causes the victim to touch or contact, either directly or through clothing, another person’s sexual parts, OR <br>
* attempts to carry out any of those acts.
 <br><br>
In case of <b>aggravated sexual assault</b> the same actions are carried out when:<br>

* the offender uses or threatens to use a weapon, OR <br>
* the offender uses or threatens to use force or other intimidating actions, OR <br>
* the victim is incapacitated or otherwise incapable of giving consent. <br><br><br>

<b>Response to the sexual assault</b><br><br>
The reaction of someone who is being sexually assaulted will depend on the context, their abilities, the number of attackers, whether the attackers are armed, and the proximity of possible help. They may react with one or a combination of the following: <br>
<u>* Active resistance.</u> Attempting to fight off or distract the attacker using anger or physical force, including struggling, screaming, or escaping. This could lead to an increasingly violent response. <br>
<u>* Passive resistance. </u> Doing or saying anything that will intimidate an attacker or persuade them to change their mind. <br>
<u>* No resistance. </u> Doing nothing at all. This may be a conscious choice to minimize harm done during the assault. It could also be tonic immobility, or “freezing”—temporary paralysis in response to extreme trauma. This does not mean that the person is consenting. <br><br>

<b>In case sexual assault has happened:</b><br>
 
<u>Step 1: Get to a safe place </u><br>
This may be locking yourself in your room or going to a neighbor’s house or to another place where you can get help. The important thing is that you distance yourself from the assailant. <br>
<u>Step 2: Call your point of contact in the country </u><br>
They may be able to provide you with critical guidance that will help protect you and guarantee your access to support services. <br>
<u>Step 3: If you have serious injuries, seek immediate treatment </u><br>
Seek immediate medical treatment if your life is at risk. If you are critically injured and need immediate help, get it. <br>
<u>Step 4: Do not go to the local police by yourself </u><br>
Dealing with the local police—especially after a trauma— can be very difficult. There can be language barriers, and you may not fully understand the legal process. If you want to report the incident to the police, ask for your local contact assistance and involvement. <br>
<u>Step 5: Protect physical evidence </u><br>
Preserving physical evidence is important if you choose to bring criminal charges against your assailant. Thus, it is best not to disturb anything that could be used as evidence—and that includes evidence that may be in or on your body. If possible, you should not shower, bathe, brush your teeth, or discard your clothes and undergarments. <br>
<u>Step 6: Tell someone </u><br>
Most important, tell someone! You do not have to go through this alone. Look for reporting options available that are designed to protect your confidentiality and privacy, as well as to provide you with various support services. <br>
