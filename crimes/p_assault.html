            <p><b>Physical assault</b> is a situation when the offender makes a deliberate aggressive, repetitive, or unwanted physical contact that may results in no injury or some injury. Aggravated physical assault is defined as an attack or threat of attack with a weapon or an object in a manner capable of inflicting major or severe bodily injury or death; or attack without a weapon or an object that results in a major or severe bodily injury. <br><br>

<b>Main mitigation measure</b> is to use situational awareness and exercise extra vigilance in the following situations:<br>

* when approaching drunk people;<br>
* when approaching people who exhibit inappropriate behavior;<br>
* when walking near places with bad reputations (certain bars, night clubs etc.);<br>
* when walking alone in a remote and isolated places after dark.<br><br>

<b>These are general tips</b> to help you develop your own personal safety strategies:<br>

<u> *Develop positive and meaningful relationships</u> with as many local people as possible (host family, community members, work partners, etc.). This is the single most effective personal safety strategy because these people may be able to protect you and warn you of possible threats of which you may not be aware of.<br>
<u> *Think about how you are perceived, </u>  which means striving to be dignified, positive, and open when you interact with people. Respect the local customs, religious beliefs, and cultural practices of your community. Avoid conduct that could be perceived as abusive or improper. The more you respect people, the more they will respect you and the better integrated you will be in your community. <br>
<u> *Be confident and act with purpose, </u>  especially when traveling, even when you are unsure about your situation. Potential perpetrators target people who appear insecure, vulnerable, or intoxicated. Projecting an air of confidence and awareness even if you are lost or feel unsafe will often deter potential attacks. <br>
<u> *Develop good security habits</u>  such as locking your doors, keeping your bag or backpack close by, not traveling with or flashing large sums of money, being aware of potentially unsafe situations, avoiding public intoxication, and refraining from using headphones when you are in public. <br>
<u> *Cultivate constant situational awareness, </u>  especially when traveling. Practice being constantly aware of your surroundings. This will help you notice abnormal patterns, events, or people that may indicate an unsafe situation. <br>
<u> *Avoid separating yourself</u>  from your personal safety and security network, including your friends and your community. Always let people know where you are going and when you will be returning. <br><br>

<b>In case physical assault has happened:</b><br>
1. Call your local contacts to ask for an advice and assistance, as you may still be in an imminent or serious danger.<br>
2. Call a doctor if you need medical assistance or counselling after the incident<br>
3. Be ready to talk to the police to file the report and provide all information, which may be useful to identify the offender(s) <br>
4. You may need to temporarily leave the site where you live or work until it is determined if it is safe for you to return<br>
