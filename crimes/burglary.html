            <p> <b>Burglary is </b> an unlawful or forcible entry of a residence, which usually, but not always, involves theft. The illegal entry may be forcible (such as breaking a window or slashing a screen) or may be without force by entering through an unlocked door or an open window. As long as the person entering has no legal right to be present in the residence, a burglary has occurred. Burglary also includes an illegal entry of a hotel room by someone other than the hotel staff. <br><br>

                <b>Main mitigation measure</b> is to make sure of the following: <br>
* All windows have latches and can close properly <br>
* Entrance door has a reliable lock (two locks for a wooden door) and a peephole<br>
* Doors and windows are locked when leaving the housing even for a short time<br>
* Other people do not have access to the keys to the entrance door<br>
* Notifying your local contact and the landlord, if the key is missing<br>
* Proper lighting in front of the entrance door and around the building<br>
* Keep valuables out of easy sight<br><br>

<b>In case burglary happened:</b><br>
1) Tell about the incident to your local contacts and the landlord who will assist you during the procedures, that will follow <br>
2) Be ready to talk to the police to file the report and provide all information, which may be useful to find the intruder <br>
3) Be prepared to move out of your housing until it is determined if it is safe for you to return or other housing must be identified                 </p>
