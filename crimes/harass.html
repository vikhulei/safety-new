            <p><b>Harassment</b> is unwanted, unwelcomed, or uninvited deliberate behavior that annoys, intimidates, offends, or alarms the person, and does cause fear and emotional distress. Harassment excludes any physical contact with the victim. Harassing behavior may include, but is not limited to, derogatory comments, slurs, vulgar propositions, visual insults, mocking, unwanted calls or text messages. <br><br>

<b>Three possible approaches for dealing with unwanted attention:</b><br>

1. Passive/avoidant - taking no action; remaining silent; changing routine or route <br>
2. Assertive - standing up for yourself while respecting the other person; respecting yourself as well as the other person; being firm and clear without being rude or threatening<br>
3. Aggressive/Attacking - expressing yourself in belligerent, hostile, or rude manner; putting yourself or your rights first at someone else’s expense; responding in a culturally insensitive manner.<br><br>
It is strongly adviced to avoid being aggressive at all costs, except in extreme cases when your personal safety is at risk.<br><br>

<b>Additional strategies for coping with unwanted attention:</b><br>

<u>* Dress appropriately.</u> Keep in mind what is culturally appropriate.<br>
<u>* Maintain your composure.</u> Try to remain calm even if you feel upset. Showing hostility may provoke a confrontation. It is best to remove yourself from a situation if you feel that you are losing control.<br>
<u>* Ignore the person who is harassing you.</u> Many
Americans are used to engaging with someone in order to be polite. But sometimes it is best to ignore the person who is bothering you.<br>
<u>* Tell your host family, counterparts, friends, and work partners</u> that certain types of behavior bother you, and they will likely help you deal with it. Many HCNs do not realize that Americans are more sensitive than they are to certain types of comments, especially racial ones. These situations can be great opportunities for cross-cultural exchange.<br>
<u>* Be assertive.</u> Always walk with confidence and purpose. Hold your head high and carry yourself as a professional who deserves respect.<br>
<u>* Nod (to acknowledge) or say “Hi” in the local language,</u> and keep walking. Simply recognizing the person can help ward off unwanted attention. Many times an inappropriate comment is an effort to get attention. But sometimes it invites continuing interaction.<br>
<u>* Pretend that you heard something else.</u> “I agree, it has been really great weather recently. Have a nice day, bye!”<br>
<u>* Use humor to deflect whatever is being said to you.</u> For example, if you are told that you would make a good lover, reply that your spouse is sure to agree. Keep walking. This may not work with a persistent person, so try different strategies as needed.<br>
<u>* Be polite but firm.</u> It is quite normal to stand your ground. “I am offended by your comment. Please do not address me in that manner.”<br>
<u>* Avoid saying, “next time.”</u> If you make statements that sound like promises, the person may try to hold you to it.<br>
<u>* If harassed by a group of children,</u> introduce yourself in the local language, and make them introduce themselves. This usually makes you less “other” to them and may very well make you some great friends.<br>
<u>* Avoid escalating the situation.</u><br><br>

You are strongly encouraged to report harassment incidents to your points of contact in the country to receive appropriate support and help with the correct interpretation of the situation.
