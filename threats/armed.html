<b><u>Since March 2014</u></b> Ukraine has been involved in an armed conflict with Russia backed military forces in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Major fighting took place in 2014 and 2015, also intensive shelling and shooting was going on during 2016-2017.<br><br>

<b><u>On May 10, 2018</u></b> Russia-led-forces (RLF) attacked Avdiyivka, Donetska oblast  trying to push out Ukrainian forces with no success. On November 9, 2018  RLF attacked Krymske, Luhanska oblast trying to push out Ukrainian forces with no success. On November 24, 2018 Ukrainian forces captured Rozsadky village, Donetska oblast and moved the line for 1.5 km to the East. Sea of Azov remains volatile.<br><br>

<b><u>The conflict is seen as localized</b></u> with no significant changes in the balance of power, though levels of violence are fluctuating. As of mid-2019 the new Ukrainian government has been taking steps to stop the conflict and negotiate with Russia. Stakeholders widely agree that invasion by Russia is “unlikely but unpredictable” in the near future.<br><br>

<b><u>If situation deteriorates,</u></b> that could affect foreign citizens placed in eastern, southern and northern oblasts or the entire country, depending on the scale of escalation.<br><br>

<b><u>Crimea occupation.</u></b> In late February 2014, days after Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich fled from Ukraine, some armed men began to take control of the Crimean Peninsula. Checkpoints were established by unmarked Russian soldiers with green military-grade uniforms and equipment in the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Simferopol, and the independently administered port-city of Sevastopol, home to a Russian naval base. After the occupation of the Crimean parliament by these unmarked troops, proved to be Russian special forces, the Crimean leadership announced it would hold a referendum on secession from Ukraine. This heavily disputed referendum was followed by the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in mid-March. Ukraine and most of the international community refused to recognize the referendum or the annexation. On 15 April, the Ukrainian parliament declared Crimea a territory temporarily occupied by Russia. Since annexing Crimea, the Russian government increased its military presence in the Penninsula. NATO stated that it believed Russia was deploying nuclear-capable weapons to Crimea. <br><br>

<b><u>Kerch Strait incident.</u></b> On 25 November 2018, near the Russia-controlled Kerch Strait, Russian warships fired on and seized three Ukrainian boats; 24 Ukrainian sailors were detained. A day later Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly backed the imposition of martial law along Ukraine's coastal regions and those bordering Russia. On 7 September 2019 all 24 sailors were returned to Ukraine during an exchange of prisoners. On 18 November 2019, the captured ships were returned to Ukraine. <br>
