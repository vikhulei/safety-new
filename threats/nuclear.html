<b><u>Chernobyl nuclear disaster</u></b>  took place in 1986 and is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history. Chernobyl exclusion zone is an area originally extending 30 kilometers (19 mi) in all directions from the plant and is officially called the "zone of alienation." Some sources have given estimates for when the site would be considered habitable again:<br>
* 320 years or less (Ukraine state authorities)<br>
* 20,000 years or more (Chernobyl director Ihor Gramotkin)<br>
* Tens of thousands of years (Greenpeace, March 2016)<br>
* 3,000 years (Christian Science Monitor, 2016)<br>
As of 2016, 187 locals had returned and were living permanently in the zone.<br><br>


<b><u>Currently, there are four active nuclear power plants</u></b> in Ukraine: in Rivnenska oblast (Varash), in Khmelnytska oblast (Netishyn), in Mykolayivska oblast (Yuzhnoukrainsk) and in Zaporizhska oblast (Enerhodar).<br> 
No major nuclear accidents have been reported since 1991. However, given a historical frequency of accidents (as recent as a 2014 short circuit in Zaporizhzhia which caused outages though it was resolved without danger of radiation to the surrounding area), plus the added possibility of nuclear accident caused by sabotage or armed conflict, probability is medium.<br>

Radiation hazards also may exist near uranium industrial mines in Kirovohradska and Dnipropetrovska oblasts.<br><br>

<b><u>In case of radiation emergency</u></b> you need to follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/emergencies/getinside.htm">CDC recommendations</a>.
