<b><u>Threat of terrorist attacks</u></b> has significantly increased after the armed conflict started in 2014. According to the State Security Service (SBU), the agency has prevented 28 terrorist attacks in Ukraine in 2016-2018 (8 of them in 2018), 35 people were detained and sentenced for terrorism in 2019. Bomb threats are also extremely disruptive, beginning during the Presidential Elections in March 2019 and increasing as a tactic throughout 2019. In 2020 the frequency has decreased, however, but this threat remains to airports, trains, train stations, bus stations, malls, public places, etc. <br><br>

<b><u>Islamic State</u></b>  is apparently seeking to send some of its members to Ukraine. According to the British press, several leading members of Islamic State have sought refuge in Ukraine. SBU claims that the individuals concerned could have plotted terrorist attacks from within the country without being detected by the local authorities.. <br><br>

<b><u>To mitigate terrorist threat,</u></b> one should remain vigilant and avoid large gatherings and demonstrations. If caught in the wrong place and time, you should try to leave the area if possible or hide in the safe place/shelter and wait for the right time to move away. <br>
