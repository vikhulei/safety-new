<b><u>The impact of COVID-19 infection</u></b> on the country is significant due to the nature of the disease and how it spreads, high density of population, and the limited ability of the country’s health system to handle a high number of infected persons.<br><br>

<b><u>Ukraine is divided</u></b> into four epidemiological zones (green, yellow, orange, and red) depending on the COVID-19 situation in each region. The Ministry of Health will assign each zone a color based on four COVID-19-related criteria. Each zone triggers a distinct set of quarantine restrictions. Local authorities should be checked regarding local quarantine guidelines. <br><br>

<b><u>Statistics.</u></b> Between the 3rd of January 2020 and the 26th of July 2021, 2,248,663 of COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Ukraine, including 52,849 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. Excess mortality data in Ukraine, however, suggest a figure somewhat above 80,000 deaths caused by the pandemic. <br><br>

<b><u>Ukraine experienced two pandemic waves</u></b> in autumn 2020 and spring 2021. The seven-day moving average, which reached its peak at the height of the second wave in April 2021 (16,038), has drastically decreased to reach 565 cases. The case fatality rate in July 2021 was 2.4%.<br><br>

<b><u>As of July 2021</u></b> Ukraine had detected several Delta cases. The government officially announced that health authorities have reagents for detecting the Delta variant, which is suspected to be circulating in the country since June 2021.<br><br>

<b><u>The national vaccination campaign</u></b> began on 24 February 2021. However, although the pace of vaccination has started to pick-up since the beginning of June, Ukraine remains the country with the lowest vaccination coverage in Europe. As of July, over 4 million doses were administered, and only about 3.6% of the total population were fully vaccinated.<br><br>
