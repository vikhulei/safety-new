<b><u>Political protests in Ukraine</u></b> have been occurring across the country in the past years, many with violence. Nation-wide protests brought about Orange Revolution in 2005 and Revolution of Dignity in 2014. Different political parties and leaders attempted to inspire large-scale protests after 2014, including M. Saakashvili in 2017, National Corps during election campaigns in 2019, No To Capitulation movement at the end of 2019.<br><br>


<b><u>The most violent event</u></b> after Revolution of Dignity took place in Kyiv in August, 2015 when one of protesters threw a grenade in the National Guards squad, 8 people were killed, 90 wounded. Another deadly bombing occurred in February, 2015, when a bomb hit a Ukrainian national unity rally in Kharkiv. The blast killed four people and injured another 10.<br><br>

<b><u>In 2017-2019 an increase of attacks on civic activists,</u></b> police departments and government buildings was observed around the country. Reportedly, around 55 attacks were committed within the period. The most known one was a deadly acid attack in Kherson against the activist Kateryna Handziuk, who died in the hospital afterwards.<br><br>

<b><u>During presidential elections</u></b> in 2019 National Corps organized numerous protests, some with violence, injuring police officers and members of public. Kyiv is the most popular city for the protests. According to 2019 poll about 48% of Ukrainians would be willing to take part in protests. This number has decreased somewhat in 2020-2021 as well as the actual number of protests, partially due to COVID-19 pandemic.
