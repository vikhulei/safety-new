<b><u>Confirmed hazardous areas</u></b>  are known, and are located in areas close to the zone of conflict.  However, military depots accross the country have accidents and grenades are used in civilian areas in all regions regularly.<br><br>

<b><u>Grenades explosions</b></u> happen in all oblasts of Ukraine. In most cases property damage or no damage is done, although sometimes human casualties are reported. Grenades are sometims used by returned soldiers and drunk people; in the majority of cases the reason is to resolve personal or business conflicts. It is not possible to predict or mitigate this threat as it may happen at any time and any place without a warning.<br><br>

<b><u>Military depots</b></u> are situated across the country, often in the close proximity to the populated areas. 14 depots explosions/fires took place in Ukraine since 2003, the latest one was in Balaklia, Kharkivska oblast on November 15, 2019.
